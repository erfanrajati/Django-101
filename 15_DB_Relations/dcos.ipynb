    "It's not possible to draw diagrams in Jupyter Notebook so I'll try to verbally explain what these mean. Imagine you're designing a database for a university LMS, it is obvious that each student can choose many subjects, and each subject can be chosen by many students. So, in case we have one table for subjects and one for students, these tables would be in *many to many* relation. One example of *one to many* relation would be instructors, each instructor can teach many subjects but each subject can be taught by one instructor. Can you think of any *one to one* relations in a university LMS database?"
