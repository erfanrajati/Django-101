    "Django is a marvel when it comes to database and administration, from it's Object Relational Mapping system to the fact that it has a built in Admin page! If you navigate to the `domain.name/admin` URL, you'll see a login page designed for django administration. But what is the username as password? And what are the things the admin can do? Those are the topics we'll talk about in this session.\n",

    "First things first, Admin is a User in the database which is exactly like any other user in terms of username, passowrd, email, and all the attributes of the User table in the database. Except, it has access to many things we'll talk about later on. Let's start by creating an admin using Django CLI."

Hash funcitons are algorithms that can encrypt any string into a fixed sized string (88 characters in this case) which cannot be decrypted back to the original string. Changing a single character in the original password will result in an entirely different hash. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Hash functions cannot be reverse engineered, keeping the passwords safe even if the datbase was compromised. The only way to decrypt a hashed string is to brute-force all possible strings to see which one would result the same hash. For the most powerfull computers these days, this process might take centuries to finish. (Not for quantum computers though!)\n",

    "#### ðŸ”¹ What Happens if the Database is Leaked?\n",
    "If an attacker gets access to the database, they can see:\n",
    "1. The **hashing algorithm** (e.g., `pbkdf2_sha256`).\n",
    "2. The **salt** used for each user.\n",
    "3. The **hashed password**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the salt is **stored with the hash**, the attacker **doesnâ€™t need to guess it**â€”they can use it directly. However, **salting still provides protection** because it prevents attackers from using **precomputed hashes (rainbow tables)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ Can an Attacker Crack the Passwords?\n",
    "Yes, but it's not **instant** because:\n",
    "- Django uses **key-stretching algorithms** like **PBKDF2, bcrypt, or Argon2**, which are **intentionally slow** to make brute-force attacks costly.\n",
    "- Each user has a **unique salt**, so the attacker **cannot** precompute a list of hashes (**rainbow table attack is useless**).\n",
    "- They have to brute-force each password **one by one**, which takes significantly longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ How an Attacker Might Proceed:\n",
    "1. They take a common password (e.g., `\"123456\"`).\n",
    "2. They hash it using the stolen salt.\n",
    "3. If the generated hash matches a stored hash, they have cracked that password.\n",
    "4. They repeat this for millions of passwords (**brute force** or a **dictionary attack**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Django uses **many iterations** (default: **600,000 for PBKDF2**), each attempt is slow, making mass attacks expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ How to Make Passwords Even More Secure:\n",
    "1. **Use a strong hashing algorithm**  \n",
    "   Djangoâ€™s default (`PBKDF2`) is good, but `Argon2` is even better for new projects:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   PASSWORD_HASHERS = [\n",
    "       'django.contrib.auth.hashers.Argon2PasswordHasher',\n",
    "   ]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. **Increase iterations** for PBKDF2:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   PASSWORD_HASHERS = [\n",
    "       ('django.contrib.auth.hashers.PBKDF2PasswordHasher', {'iterations': 1200000}),\n",
    "   ]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. **Use two-factor authentication (2FA)**  \n",
    "   Even if an attacker cracks a password, they wonâ€™t get in without 2FA.\n",
    "4. **Monitor for breaches**  \n",
    "   Services like **Have I Been Pwned** can help detect if usersâ€™ passwords have been leaked.\n",
