    "# Database\n",
    "\n",
    "No need to explain the importance of this section if you're like me! Database is the core of every real life project out there. In a real website, there will be a ton of data spreading around, form submisions, user credentials, pictures, posts, etc. All of them play a signifact role in website porgramming. The thing is that just like every other concept in programming, it's faily easy to get messed up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here comes the Database, a fundamental idea of controlling the storage of data in software engineering, whether it's a website, an app, a cloud based service, Database plays a huge role. With that said, let's get to work!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Temporary Data: This data is stored in the memory. As soon as the app proces is killed, this data is deleted from memory and needs to be reloaded. Like the python list we made in the previous project for our blog posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Semi-Temporary Data: Coockies, Sessions, etc. This data is stored in the browser cache for a short time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Presistent Data: All the data that you need to hold onto for a long time. This type of data is store in the website database; which could be a SQL database or a non-SQL database. This tutorial follows the SQL databases and their interaction with Django.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see that as soon as you run your project for the first time, a Database file is generate at your project root called `db.sqlite3`. Note that you can add this on your own but make sure you name it the same as what you see in `settings.py > DATABASES`. Long story short, sqlite is a light-weight database which is perfect for small project. However, MySQL is the more advanced alternative which we'll talk about later on."

    "\n",
    "Depending on the Back-End framework you use, it might have a built in **Object Relational Mapping (ORM)** system which translates the code you write in that languge to SQL. hence, although recommended, it's not crucial to learn SQL to get some hands-on database experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Django is no exception. Essentially, Django is a **Model Template View** frame work. Meaning that all of the process Django does is categoriezed in one of those three. We are already familiar with Template and View, which were in charge of getting the user request and rendering the response view. Models however, are the core idea behind presistant data."

    "To create a database schema we need to remember all the things we learned from Object Oriented Programming. We must first research the business we're making a website for in order to figure out which entities there is. Each entitiy is implementd using a Python class and later on translated to an SQL relation (table) in the database.\n",

    "#### ✅ When You Should Run `migrate` Right After `makemigrations`\n",
    "1. **Local Development:**  \n",
    "   - If you’re actively working on your project and making model changes, running `migrate` right after `makemigrations` keeps your database schema up to date.  \n",
    "   - Example:  \n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     python manage.py makemigrations\n",
    "     python manage.py migrate\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Deploying to Production:**  \n",
    "   - When deploying a Django app, you typically run `makemigrations` in development, commit the migration files, and then run `migrate` on the production server to apply the changes.  \n",
    "   - Example (on the server):  \n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     python manage.py migrate --noinput\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🚀 When You Should NOT Run `migrate` Immediately\n",
    "1. **If You Need to Review the Migrations First:**  \n",
    "   - Sometimes, running `makemigrations` creates unexpected migrations (e.g., Django auto-generates a migration you didn’t intend).  \n",
    "   - You can **check the migration file** before applying it:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     python manage.py sqlmigrate app_name 0001\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     This shows the SQL commands Django would run.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **If You Need to Manually Edit a Migration File:**  \n",
    "   - If the automatically generated migration isn’t quite right, you may want to **edit the file** before running `migrate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **If You Are Working in a Team and Using Version Control:**  \n",
    "   - You might generate migrations (`makemigrations`), commit them, and let others apply them later (`migrate`).  \n",
    "   - This prevents conflicts when multiple developers work on the same database schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🎯 Best Practice in a Team\n",
    "1. **Developers run `makemigrations` locally** when changing models.\n",
    "2. **They commit the migration files** (so others don’t have to re-run `makemigrations`).\n",
    "3. **On production, the `migrate` command is run** to apply the changes.\n",
